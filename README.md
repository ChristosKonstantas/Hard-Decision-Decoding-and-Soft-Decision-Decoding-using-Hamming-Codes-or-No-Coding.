# Hard-Decision-Decoding-and-Soft-Decision-Decoding-using-Hamming-Codes-or-No-Coding.

Binary sequences of independent and uniformly distributed bits are transmitted via zero-mean additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel with standard deviation σ. 
We consider that we have three options for transmitting data on the channel: i) no coding, ii) Hamming Coding(n = 7, k = 4), and iii) Hamming Coding (n = 15, k = 11). 
The energy per bit of information is Eb and is the energy per modulated bit is Ec=(k/n)*Eb. 
Also SNR=(Eb/(σ^2)). The task is to run 1 million Monte Carlo experimentsfor SNR values from 0dB to 12dB, with a step of 3dB ̹and plot the average information bit error probability as a function of SNR  for optimal detection in case (i) optimal hard-decision decoding (HDD) and soft-decision decoding (SDD) in cases (ii) and (iii).
